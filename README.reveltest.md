# Reveltest, Zen Clark's sandbox web program.

At the moment this proof of concept for an anonymous micro-blogging/public messaging system and for learning the Revel framework.
No SSL, accounts, or fancy web pages are included. 

It uses a MS SQL backend because that is what I had available at the time, and the Raspberry Pi 2 B
that I am developing it on does not have the RAM to run its own database server.

If I flesh this out more, I might spin the micro-blogging system into its own dedicated project instead of a sandbox repository.
